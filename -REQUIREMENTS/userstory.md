User Story: Plan, break down, and complete school/work tasks without getting overwhelmed

As a busy student/worker who struggles with time management and staying focused, I want an app that helps me plan my tasks, break them into manageable steps, and stay aware of my workload and wellbeing, so that I can start earlier, meet deadlines, and avoid burnout.

Acceptance Criteria:

Scheduling
I can create a task (e.g., assignment, project, work deliverable) and block time for it on a calendar.
I can schedule multiple sessions for the same task (so I can start early and spread work out).
The schedule view makes it clear what I’m doing and when, reducing confusion and last-minute rushing.

Step-by-step structure
When a task feels too big, I can use a feature that breaks it into smaller steps.
The steps are displayed in a way that is easy to follow, helping me know where to start.
Each step is actionable (not vague), so I can make progress even when motivation is low.

Self Check-in
I can mark my mood (ex: great/neutral/etc.) while working on tasks or after sessions.
The app shows mood information visually over time, helping me notice patterns (ex: burnout building, stress spikes).

Suggestions
Based on my recent activity, I can receive guided notes or recommendations (resources, next steps, suggested study actions).
Suggestions help me avoid feeling “lost” and reduce the chance I stop working due to overwhelm.

Supports focus without being too strict
The app feels like a supportive partner (helpful prompts, structure), not a controlling manager. 
The planning system is flexible, so I can adjust without feeling punished if I fall behind.
